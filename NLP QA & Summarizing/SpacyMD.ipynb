    "A Question Answering (QA) system in spaCy works by taking a question and a context as input. The question and context are tokenized and assigned numerical representations called embeddings. These embeddings capture the meaning of the tokens in a continuous vector space. The tokens are then processed through encoding layers and attention mechanisms to understand their contextual dependencies and importance. The encoded question and context representations are combined to facilitate interaction. The model predicts the start and end positions of the answer within the context by applying classification layers or probability distributions over the tokens. The corresponding tokens are extracted as the predicted answer and post-processed to provide the final answer. Building a complete QA system may require additional components and techniques, but spaCy provides the necessary tools for tokenization, encoding, and context understanding."
